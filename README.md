# basic-python-pathfinder
Simple pathfinding algorithm that find the shortest path between two points. 

The pathfinder works by finding the inverse tan of the inverse slope then moving the "cursor" by 1 coordinate in the appropriate direction.

To use this;
In the 2D list named 'map', add your start point by replacing a 0 with a 1 and your end point by replacing a zero with a 2. 

Run the script and the console will display current coordinates, angle to the destination and the move taken.
